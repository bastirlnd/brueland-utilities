### Functionality TL:DR
This script takes an input file containing multiple JSON objects (one per line). These objects must have a field "size" with an INT value.
If this input is given the script will write a file with all sizes sorted from largest to smallest.

TODO:
- Add support for name, value pair to identify which object belongs to which file
